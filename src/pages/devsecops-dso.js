                  <h3>Why DevSecOps?</h3>
                  <p>DevSecOps is a combination of Software Development (Dev), Cybersecurity (Sec) and Information Technology Operations (Ops). Combining these factors together allows for speeding the software delivery that makes continuous collaboration, automation, communication, and integration possible. With these processes, software delivery is prioritized based on risk and scanning for security vulnerabilities is increased and optimized into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipelines.</p>
                  <p>DevOps accelerates the pace of digital business, but the constant change to production introduces considerable security threats and risk to business operations and regulatory compliance.</p>
                  <p>Avoiding and mitigating these threats and risks in your DevOps initiatives by following security best practices will help your organization deliver secure products to your customers and avoid regulatory scrutiny or possibly fines.</p>
