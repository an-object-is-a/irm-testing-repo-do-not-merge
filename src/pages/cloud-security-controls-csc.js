                <h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
                <p>Security in the cloud is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and its customer. Organizations that assume that the cloud provider does everything and fail to recognize their responsibility get into trouble.</p>
                <p>In the world of SaaS, the application provider secures the underlying physical infrastructure, network, OS, and application, freeing up customers to focus their efforts on identity and access management (IAM) and data protection. The challenge is that businesses often forget that keeping track of who has access, and what that access is used for, is still their responsibility.</p>

                        <p>Cloud Service Providers expose a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that customers use to manage and interact with cloud services (also known as the management plane). These APIs can contain the same software vulnerabilities as an API for an operating system, library, etc. These APIs are accessible via the Internet exposing them more broadly to potential exploitation.</p>

                        <h3>#2 Separation Among Multiple Tenants Fail.</h3>
                        <p>Exploitation of system and software vulnerabilities within a Cloud Service Provider’s infrastructure, platforms, or applications that support multi-tenancy can lead to a failure to maintain separation among tenants. This failure can be used by an attacker to gain access from one organization’s resource to another user’s or organization’s assets or data. Multi-tenancy increases the attack surface, leading to an increased chance of data leakage if the separation controls fail.</p>

                        <p>Threats associated with data access, residency and deletion exist because the consumer has reduced visibility into where their data is physically stored in the cloud and a reduced ability to verify the secure deletion of their data.</p>
                        <p>This risk is concerning because the data is spread over a number of different storage devices within the Cloud Service Provider’s infrastructure in a multi-tenancy environment. In addition, deletion procedures may differ from provider to provider. Organizations may not be able to verify that their data was securely deleted and that remnants of the data are not available to attackers.</p>
